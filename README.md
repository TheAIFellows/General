### WHO WE ARE

Hi! This is the GitHub repository of this community!
I'm the Big Fellow and with me there is Robbie, our ambassador from the Republic of Robots!

The goal of this community is to provide the best knowledge possible in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
There are many people who cannot afford the education they deserve, due social and economic difficulties.
We opened the Instagram page to share our knowledge to people who desires to learn and improve theirselves!
I am a Machine Learning Engineer and my love for AI started many years ago.
Since I was a child I've always been affascinated by Technology and Science.
I chose to devolve my life to try to improve humankind through Technology, studying as hard as I can to
reach the highest level of skills and knowledge.
The journey is not already finished, and my motivation and commitment for the cause grow bigger day by day!

### OUR GOAL

I've reached a point in my life in which hard work is paying me back, and I feel this is the right moment
to share what I have with less fortunate.
I'm not looking for money or fame, my only focus is to help people to overcome the same difficulties I faced in the past.

The AI Fellows page tries everyday to publish high-level content to teach people the main concepts of Artificial Intelligence.
Many fellows from all over the world, especially from India and North Africa, ask help everyday in DM about projects or topics they don't fully understand.
The page cannot provide the proper help they deserve, this is why I came up with an amazing idea!

I WANT TO CREATE AN ACCADEMY!

Yeah, you heard right!!! It will not be an easy thing to do, the process is complex and expensive.
But I feel that this is the right thing to do.

### ACCADEMY FEATURES

This accademy will offer a full-comprehensive course about the keypoints of Artificial Intelligence.
It will be FULLY in remote, with video-lessons for theory and notebook for exercised!
There will be also a Discord server for helping each other and share thoughts and energies!
A Twitch channel will also be opened to stream live coding sessions, and have fun together!
But also, the Twitch channel will also give the opportunity to express the skills of followers,
hosting with our workstations real-world projects upvoted by the community!
With a raffle mechanisms, some follower will be chosen from the stream to use our workstations
to implement State of The Art solutions!

Lectures topic will be:
* Linear Algebra
* Calculus
* Probability and Statistics
* Convex Optimization
* Algorithms & OOP with Python
* Main concepts of Data Science
* Machine Learning
* Priciples of Neural Engineering
* Deep Learning
* Computer Vision
* Natural Language Processing
* Time Series Forecasting
* Reinforncement Learning

### PRICE
The course will not be free, it will cost ONE DOLLAR for a specific reason:
Nothing worthy is free, everyone must commit to a cause, must put all the efforst pursuing one goal.
This is what I'm still doing and I will not pass the concept that results can be achieved without effort.

WHY JUST ONE DOLLAR??? Well, I did some statistics to find out the right price for the course.
I ask for commitment and not for money, and 1$ is almost the average price of a can of Coke between
the 25 most poor countries all over the world.
1$ is a symbol, not a price. I paid much more money for my education, money that I gain with blood and tears.
For the same blood and tears I want to help others. Noone has to suffer about money or politics conditions when we are
talking about education.

### CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, I'm here to ask help make the dream come true!
I created these NFTs to finance my big project!!!
The final price comprehends:
* workstations for Deep Learning and streaming;
* high-end laptop to create content during work travels:
* audio and video setup;
* 2 years salary for hiring two coworkers;
* 2 years foundings to allow me focus ONLY on this project, putting aside all my economic situations;
* "marketing" costs for advertising the course all over the world;
