### WHO WE ARE

Hi! This is the GitHub repository of this community!
I'm the Big Fellow and with me there is Robbie, our ambassador from the Republic of Robots!

The goal of this community is to provide the best knowledge possible in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
There are many people who cannot afford the education they deserve, due social and economic difficulties.
We opened the Instagram page to share our knowledge to people who desires to learn and improve theirselves!
I am a Machine Learning Engineer and my love for AI started many years ago.
Since I was a child I've always been affascinated by Technology and Science.
I chose to devolve my life to try to improve humankind through Technology, studying as hard as I can to
reach the highest level of skills and knowledge.
The journey is not already finished, and my motivation and commitment for the cause grow bigger day by day!

### OUR GOAL

I've reached a point in my life in which hard work is paying me back, and I feel this is the right moment
to share what I have with less fortunate.
I'm not looking for money or fame, my only focus is to help people to overcome the same difficulties I faced in the past.

The AI Fellows page tries everyday to publish high-level content to teach people the main concepts of Artificial Intelligence.
Many fellows from all over the world, especially from India and North Africa, ask help everyday in DM about projects or topics they don't fully understand.
The page cannot provide the proper help they deserve, this is why I came up with an amazing idea!

I WANT TO CREATE AN ACCADEMY!

Yeah, you heard right!!! It will not be an easy thing to do, the process is complex and expensive.
But I feel that this is the right thing to do.
